# Analysing grey seal movement tracks in the North Sea

This is a repo for using MovingPandas to analyse the movement of a seal and make a map for the #30DayMapChallenge "Movement" theme (hopefully)!

## The data used here is from Movebank:

Relevant data info from Michelot T, Blackwell PG (2019):

- "Trajectory of 2,535 observations, collected in the North Sea between April and December 2008".
- "The base sampling frequency was of one location every 30 min, but many fixes were missed, and the resulting time grid was highly irregular...".
